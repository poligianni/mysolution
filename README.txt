The solution requires .net core 2.2.
It can be built and run using 'start.bat'

The solution MySolution.sln can also be opened in Visual Studio 2017.
- The main code with the functions is in MySolution.MyLibrary.
- It includes MySolution.ConsoleApp which allows a user to enter a text string and outputs the found palindromes.
- It also includes MySolution.MyLibrary.Test with test cases.

Notes:
- In the example substrings were not included, but it was not specifically mentioned, so I implemented two versions
- I am considering spaces as valid characters, so they are included as part of the string match
- he string match is case sensitive
